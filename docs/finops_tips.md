# FinOps Tips

- Always tag resources with owner and environment.
- Monitor sudden spikes in unit cost to catch misconfigurations.
- Decommission idle resources quickly to avoid waste.
- Compare current month vs previous to detect anomalies.
- Regularly review “zero cost” rows — may indicate unused but provisioned resources.
- Set budgets and alerts before costs exceed expectations.
